        "The patron saint of animals and the environment, Archangel Ariel name
        means lion or lioness of God'. Her role is to protect the earth, its
        natural resources, ecosystems and wild life and is always availiable
        to support and guidance for any activities that involve
        environmentalism and protecting, healing, rejuvenating, and/or
        matianing our environment. Archangel Ariel assists in healing injured
        animals working closely with Archangel Raphael in these endeavor. It
        is believed she also works to oversee the order of physical universe
        including plants, the sun, the moons and the stars. When seeking to
        learn more about nature or connect more deeply while hiking or
        exploring, she assists in providing insights and opportunities to
        expand your awareness and experiece. Given Archangel Ariel is watching

      <p style="color: aquamarine">
        (Her History) In the Bible, Ariel's name is used to refer to the holy
        city of Jerusalem in Isaiah 29, but the passage itself doesn't refer
        to Archangel Ariel. The Jewish apocryphal text the Wisdom of Solomon
        describes Ariel as an angel who punishes demons. The Christian Gnostic
        text Pistis Sophia also says that Ariel works punishing the wicked.
        Later texts describe Ariel's role caring for nature, including the
        "Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels" (published in the 1600s), which
        calls Ariel "Earth's great lord."

        "A four season climate offers so much more to life than a one season
        climate. Each of the four seasons is a different life experience and
        is uniquie in its own way. Some people may disagree, because some
        people don't like the different seasons changing and the cold of the
        winter. However, if people really embrace the seasons, the pros
        outweigh the cons of living in a four season climate. A four season
        climate has benefits of more types of activities Each season offers a
        different group of sports to play as well as different hobby
        activities. The variety of weather changes makes a four-season climate
        interesting. It is hard to be bored with a season because itâ€™s always
        changing, and there is always next season to look forward to.
        Different seasons have become associated with different holidays.
        Spring is cool but just starting to get warm for Easter. Summer is hot
        and has the benefits of the 4th of July and all of the great summer
        activities. Fall cools down a little bit after all of the heat, and
        there is Thanksgiving and the colorful leaves. And once the snow has
        fallen, then comes Christmas with snow and decorations and lights.
        Each of these holidays has something special about it because of the
        changing weather.
