          This Page Leads to the Second Project of the Udacity Assignments. I
          made this Blog to link with the LandingPage as it shows what it does
          in the Description, Even though it was not require, I couldn't stop
          myself from adding it in the Post Blog, due to because I really
          thought it would be a cool feature to have.

        <h1><u>Land Page Description</u></h1>
        <p>
          The Landing Page is consist of an entire Website Homepage, that has a
          smooth scroll effect and variety of different links to specific pages,
          It took quite some time to get all together. But in the end it was all
          worth it, enjoy going into the ShoeShop, Learning How Van Shoes are
          made, scroll through the LinkedIn Website. Read the readme, or even
          better get a cup of coffee, relax, and jam to a christmas song. This
          Landing Page will provide all these features and I hope you enjoy it!
