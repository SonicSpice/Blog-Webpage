        <p>
          My Name is Shawn Mak, I am 19 years old. I'm currently enroll in a
          Online Trade School Program as a Front End Web Developer Known as
          Udacity. Some of my hobbies are Coding Projects, Reading History
          Books, Basketball, Music, Playing Video Games and Reading About
          Biblical Literature. I have always been open to learning different
          skills, I am always a positive and confident person and I never get
          negativity bring me down. Some of my dislikes are, not being able to
          figrue out the error of a code, reading boring drama books, listening
          to annoying and boring music, and people who makes ludicrous
          assumption on Biblical Literature. I am very untested in Tech
          Companies and hope that I get to work in one soon. Some of my job
          interests is Samsung, Sony, Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Apple, Google,
          Youtube, and even Udacity. I love learning about the art of Coding
          Computers and it's different variety of languages like Java,
          Javascript, Html, Css, Python, Robot C and many more. If any Tech
          Company that is willing to hire me, I would be honor and willing to
          give my all into the worked.
