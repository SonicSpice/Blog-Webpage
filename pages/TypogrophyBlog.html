              <p><q>Nature is the type of ecology that everyone needs, therefore as human being 
                 we must do our part and be green all day. By keeping recycling materials that we
                 used everday; this way we can keep the earth clean and waste materials less.

                    <q>Since we astronomers are priests of the highest God in regard to the
                     book of nature, it befits us to be thoughtful, not of the glory of our minds,
