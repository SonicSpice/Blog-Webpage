                " In my opinion, Nature is the type of ecology that everyone needs, therefore as human being 
                 we must do our part and be green all day. By keeping recycling materials that we
                 used everday; this way we can keep the earth clean and waste materials less.
                 That is why everyday should be Earth Day" - Lad
