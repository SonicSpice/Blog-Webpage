        <h1> Ecosia Info </h1>

        <p style="color: yellowgreen">"Ecosia is a search engine based in Berlin, Germany, that donates 80% or more of its profits to nonprofit organizations 
            that focus on reforestation and planting trees where they are needed most. It considers itself a social business, is CO2-negative and claims to support full financial transparency
            and protect the privacy of its users. Ecosia is also B Lab-certified."</p>

          <h1>Ecosia History</h1>
          <p style="color: lawngreen"> "Ecosia was launched on 7 December 2009 to coincide with UN climate talks in Copenhagen.
             Over time, Ecosia has supported various tree-planting programs. Until December 2010, Ecosia's funds went to a program by WWF Germany that protected the Juruena National Park in the Amazon basin. 
            To protect this area, the organizers drew up and financed plans with timber companies and the local communities." In 2011, the search engine had raised over 250,000€.
            From July 2013 to September 2014, Ecosia donated to the Plant a Billion Trees program run by The Nature Conservancy, a program that aimed to restore the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by planting one million native trees by 2015. 
            In 2015, Ecosia began funding reforestation in Burkina Faso as part of the Great Green Wall project, backed by the African Union and the World Bank, that aims to prevent desertification. </p>
            According to B-labs, as of January 2015, "In donating 80 percent of its ad revenue, the search engine has raised over $1.5 million for rainforest protection since its founding in December 2009." 
            According to Ecosia, by 2015, the search engine had almost 2.5 million active users and had planted more than 2 million trees.
            In May 2015, Ecosia was shortlisted for The Europas, the European Tech Startups Awards, under the category Best European Startup Aimed At Improving Society.
            On October 9th 2018, Ecosia offered €1 million to buy the Hambach Forest from German energy company RWE AG to save it from being cut down for lignite mining. RWE declined the offer.
            On the 23rd of January 2020, Ecosia donated all of its profits from that day to ReForest Now, a local NGO that not only plans to restore the forests, but also "make the area more resilient against future fires".
             They stated that the profits were used to plant 26,446 trees."
