      <h2>Angel History</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      In the Bible, Ariel's name is used to refer to the holy
      city of Jerusalem in Isaiah 29, but the passage itself doesn't refer
      to Archangel Ariel. The Jewish apocryphal text the Wisdom of Solomon
      describes Ariel as an angel who punishes demons. The Christian Gnostic
      text Pistis Sophia also says that Ariel works punishing the wicked.
      Later texts describe Ariel's role caring for nature, including the
      "Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels" (published in the 1600s), which
      calls Ariel "Earth's great lord.

      The Four seasons happen because of the tilt of the earth axis."
      At the different time of the year, the sun's ray hit different parts
      of the globe more directly."
      The angle of the Earth's axis tilts the Nothern Hemisphere toward the
      sun during the summner."
      Without the tilt of the earth's axis, we wouldn't have seasons."

      <h2> The Importance of Nature</h2>

        "A four season climate offers so much more to life than a one season
        climate. Each of the four seasons is a different life experience and
        is uniquie in its own way. Some people may disagree, because some
        people don't like the different seasons changing and the cold of the
        winter. However, if people really embrace the seasons, the pros
        outweigh the cons of living in a four season climate.A four season
        climate has benefits of more types of activities Each season offers a
        different group of sports to play as well as different hobby
        activities. The variety of weather changes makes a four-season climate
        interesting. It is hard to be bored with a season because itâ€™s always
        changing, and there is always next season to look forward to.
        Different seasons have become associated with different holidays.
        Spring is cool but just starting to get warm for Easter. Summer is hot
        and has the benefits of the 4th of July and all of the great summer
        activities. Fall cools down a little bit after all of the heat, and
        there is Thanksgiving and the colorful leaves. And once the snow has
        fallen, then comes Christmas with snow and decorations and lights.
        Each of these holidays has something special about it because of the
        changing weather.
