          The Four seasons happen because of the tilt of the earth axis. At the
          different time of the year, the sun's ray hit different parts of the
          globe more directly. The angle of the Earth's axis tilts the Northern
          Hemisphere toward the sun during the summer. Without the tilt of the
          earth's axis, we wouldn't have seasons.

        <h3><u>The Importance of Nature</u></h3>
        <p>
          A four season climate offers so much more to life than a one season
          climate. Each of the four seasons is a different life experience and
          is unique in its own way. Some people may disagree, because some
          people don't like the different seasons changing and the cold of the
          winter. However, if people really embrace the seasons, the pros
          outweigh the cons of living in a four season climate.A four season
          climate has benefits of more types of activities Each season offers a
          different group of sports to play as well as different hobby
          activities. The variety of weather changes makes a four-season climate
          interesting. It is hard to be bored with a season because itâ€™s always
          changing, and there is always next season to look forward to.
          Different seasons have become associated with different holidays.
          Spring is cool but just starting to get warm for Easter. Summer is hot
          and has the benefits of the 4th of July and all of the great summer
          activities. Fall cools down a little bit after all of the heat, and
          there is Thanksgiving and the colorful leaves. And once the snow has
          fallen, then comes Christmas with snow and decorations and lights.
          Each of these holidays has something special about it because of the
          changing weather.

          <h1><u>History of Ariel</u></h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          In the Bible, Ariel's name is used to refer to the holy city of
          Jerusalem in Isaiah 29, but the passage itself doesn't refer to
          Archangel Ariel. The Jewish apocryphal text the Wisdom of Solomon
          describes Ariel as an angel who punishes demons. The Christian Gnostic
          text Pistes Sophia also says that Ariel works punishing the wicked.
          Later texts describe Ariel's role caring for nature, including the
          "Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels" (published in the 1600s), which
          calls Ariel "Earth's great lord.
