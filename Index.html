<li> Spring when it rains the most</h1> 
<li> Summer is very hot</h2>             
<li> Autumn wonderful breeze, best season in my opinion</h3>
<li> Winter Freezing Cold and alot of snow </h4>
    
<p> Spring is the time for greens to bloom: Trees, Bushes, Plants, and Grass
<p> Summer is going to be really hot and it is the perfect time to swim at the beach </p>
<p> Autum is the time for green leaves to fall and grow color leaves: yellow orange red and brown <p>
<p> Winter is icy cold with lots of blizzards and snow falling from the icy clouds. </p>
